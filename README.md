Some solutions in Ada/SPARK.

| Day | Place                         | SPARK? |
| --- | ----------------------------- | ------ |
| 1   | [day1.adb](day1/src/day1.adb) | Yes    |

## Build instructions

Install [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev/) and navigate to the given day (e.g.
`cd day1`). Run `alr run` to execute the code, and `alr gnatprove` to verify it.

Input data is usually hardcoded to be an `inputs.txt` file.
